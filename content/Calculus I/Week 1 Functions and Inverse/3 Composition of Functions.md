#### **Product of Functions Definition:**
```
Given functions f(x) and g(x) we can form their product f g:
(fg)(x) = f(x)g(x)
```
>[!example]
$$f(x) = \sqrt{x} \to Domain: [0, ∞)$$
$$g(x) = x + 2 \to Domain: ℝ$$
$$(fg)(x) = (x + 2)\sqrt{x} \to Domain: [0, ∞)$$

#### **Composition of Functions Definition:**
```
If f(x) and g(x) are two functions, the composite function f ∘ g is defined by:
(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x))
```
> [!example]
$$f(x) = x^2 - x$$
$$g(x) = \sin(x)$$
$$(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(\sin(x)) = (\sin(x))^2-(\sin(x))$$
$$(g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x^2-x) = \sin(x^2-x)$$
